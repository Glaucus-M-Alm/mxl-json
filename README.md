# mxl-json
converting compressed musicxml to json
To use this you need the packages fs, xml2json and jszip
                                                                                                                                                                                    
var schema = {
        object: joi.boolean().default(true); this variable in xml2json is false by default change it to true.
        
        
        The file MXL-JSON.js takes only parts of the musicxml for an especific project of mine
